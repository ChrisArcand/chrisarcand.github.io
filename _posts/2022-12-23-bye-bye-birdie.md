In some ways, I should be furious that a self-indulgent billionaire manbaby brought about the
practical end of Twitter.

Twitter was once a very positive platform for my [tech] career and keeping in
touch with colleagues throughout the industry. There are multiple people I met solely on Twitter and
then engaged with in person at whatever conference only after engaging with them a whole year prior;
some of these people are now close friends nearly a decade later. I've gotten jobs from knowing people and companies via
Twitter. I've been kept critically informed in real time on important current events happening in
the world. The phenomena of a sizeable percentage of traditional news outlet content literally being
'Breaking News: Someone tweeted X yesterday' should be well noted by now. And hey, all that on top
of the same platform entertaining me as a consistent pipeline of pointless shitposts during
extended family holiday get-togethers? Amazing.

But this practical end of Twitter is really only an accelerated demise; Elom didn't ruin Twitter, he
only [laughably, horrifyingly, honestly-impressively] has done such an inconceivably terrible job
since acquiring it that he made the long-burn end come so much faster than anyone could have ever
anticipated. It's been years now that I (and many others, I know) have looked in the mirror and
wondered what I even get out of Twitter and social media in its current form. Even with the
positives held constant (though they haven't been, I'd say), the number of negatives has long since grown
such that the net experience is a toxic one for many.

As a cis white dude in tech named 'Chris' (a frequent archetype, as you can imagine) I'm aware that
if I consider my social media experience 'toxic' while playing the game of life on 'Easy Mode' it
must be an order of magnitude more toxic for many, many others. I experience no death threats or
marginalization on the basis of my ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, etc. I know many, many
people that do.

> Traditional, centralized social media companies rely solely on doing **anything** to continue your unwitting desire to click on random bullshit indefinitely.

One major negative that has affected *everyone* to some degree is the nature of traditional social
media's reliance on the advertising revenue model. We've reached critical mass of advertising
revenue on these platforms being squeezed to its absolute unbearable limit. A sporting event or
streaming video platform will forever have the upper hand in forcing an onslaught of advertisements in
front of your face for the full duration of the product you want to consume to a finite end.
Traditional, centralized social media companies, however, rely solely on doing _anything_ to
continue your unwitting desire to click on random bullshit indefinitely. You know, your
_engagement_.

The endless attempts at engagement to drive the beast that is an advertising revenue model have long
made Twitter an awful experience. No, consuming Twitter via a 3rd party product like Tweetbot was
never a complete alternative. Although advertising methods will continue to be developed long in to
the future to support such a model in general - I'm looking at you, NHL, with your [digitally
enhanced dashboards debuting this hockey
season](https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/34717938/nhl-debut-digitally-enhanced-dasherboards-virtual-ads-replace-traditional-signage-arena-rink-boards) - 
I think we're reaching a point where people are more willing to find niche alternatives or Just Not
Do It™ when it comes to social media.

And so, ironically, I should instead be thanking Elom for expeditiously throwing Twitter in a burning
dumpster with shocking efficiency. I can waffle back and forth for years about the nature of my
social media usage, the effect of relentless engagement and its propensity to cause someone to be
unable to [embrace boredom](https://chrisarcand.com/embrace-boredom/) and distract themselves from
experience real life - but it's extremely easy to draw a hard line at "[I refuse to support far right
conspiracy theorists and Nazis.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/elon-musk-twitter-far-right-activist/672436/)"

#### The Year Of Mastodon (and the 'Fediverse') On The Desktop

The events of the last two months(!) have pushed people to alternatives in [a way that we've never
experienced before.](https://mashable.com/article/mastodon-millions-users) I'd been hoping for a
long time that an alternative would become popular and viable (I just recently discovered I have a
mastodon.social account from 2018!); it seems that Mastodon is finally becoming just that. I've only
been using it for a couple days on this last go around, but the experience is far, far different
with so many people embracing it and eyeing Twitter burning in a dumpster in their rear view mirror.

I'm very keen on the web returning to the idea of [protocols over
platforms](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech).
To that end, I'm indefinitely limiting my Twitter usage and going in on the 'Fediverse' and one of the
few instances in the modern hype cycle of Decentralized Everything that - dare I say - may actually
make great sense: decentralized social media. I've removed all main links to Twitter from my website,
removed all usage of Twitter as a 3rd party OAuth provider, and replaced what I can with my Mastodon
account: [@chrisarcand@hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@chrisarcand).

Mastodon may not end up being the long game implementation of choice in the decentralized social
media game; hell, maybe even Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's [Bluesky Social](https://blueskyweb.org/)
and the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) will be. But it's clear that whatever The Next Twitter
is, it will (or _should_) be built on the tenants of decentralization and shared governance in a way that doesn't
fit any single company trying to get rich on advertising and engagement, and I'm thrilled about it.

God I miss RSS.
