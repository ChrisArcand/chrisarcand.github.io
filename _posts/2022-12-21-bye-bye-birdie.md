description: The accelerated demise of Twitter and moving on to (gasp) decentralized social media."

In some ways, I should be furious that a self-indulgent billionaire manbaby brought about the
practical end of Twitter.

Twitter has been overall a very positive platform for my [tech] career and keeping in
touch with colleagues throughout the industry. There are multiple people I met solely on Twitter and
then engaged with in person at whatever conference only after engaging with them a whole year prior;
some of these people are now close friends. I've gotten jobs from knowing people and companies via
Twitter. I've been kept critically informed in real time on important current events happening in
the world. The phenomena of a sizeable percentage of traditional news outlet content literally being
'Breaking News: Someone tweeted X yesterday' should be well noted by now. And hey, all that on top
of the same platform entertaining me as a consistent pipeline of pointless shitposts during
extended family holiday get-togethers? Amazing.

But this practical end of Twitter is really only a accelerated demise; Elom didn't ruin Twitter, he
only [laughably, horrifyingly, honestly-impressively] has done such an inconceivably terrible job
since acquiring it that he made the long-burn end come so much faster than anyone could have ever
anticipated. It's been years now that I (and many others, I know) have looked in the mirror and
wondered what I even get out of Twitter and social media in its current form. Even with the
positives held constant (though they haven't been, I'd say), the number of negatives has long since grown
such that the net experience is a toxic one for many.

There are far too many topics to discuss when it comes to 'Horrible things about Twitter and
traditional social media', and as a cis white dude in tech named 'Chris' (a frequent archetype, as
you can imagine) I'm aware that if I consider my social media experience 'toxic'
while playing the game of life on 'Easy Mode' it must be an order of magnitude more toxic for many,
many others. I experience no death threats or marginalization on the basis of my ethnicity, sexual
orientation, gender, etc. I know many, many people that do.

One major negative that affects *everyone* to some degree is the nature of social media's reliance
on the classic advertising revenue model. I think we've reached critical mass of advertising revenue
being squeezed to its limits in social media companies. A sporting event or streaming video platform
will forever have the upper hand in forcing an onslaught advertisements in front of your face for
the full duration of the product you want to consume to a finite end, but social media relies solely
on continuing your desire to click on random bullshit indefinitely. You know, your _engagement_.

The endless attempts at engagement to drive the beast that is an advertising revenue model have long
made Twitter an awful experience. <footnote> No, consuming Twitter via a 3rd party product like
Tweetbot was never a complete alternative. Although advertising methods will continue to be
developed long in to the future to support such a model in general - I'm looking at you, NHL, with
your ['digitally enhanced dashboards' debuting this hockey season](https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/34717938/nhl-debut-digitally-enhanced-dasherboards-virtual-ads-replace-traditional-signage-arena-rink-boards) - I
think we're reaching a point where people are more willing to find niche alternatives or Just Not Do Itâ„¢ when it comes to social media.

And so, ironically, I should instead be thanking Elom for expeditiously throwing Twitter in a burning
dumpster with shocking efficiency. I can waffle back and forth for years about the nature of my
social media usage, the effect of relentless engagement its propensity to cause someone to be
[unable to embrace boredom](https://chrisarcand.com/embrace-boredom/) and distract themselves from
experience real life - but it's extremely easy to draw a hard line at "[I refuse to support far right
conspiracy theorists and Nazis.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/elon-musk-twitter-far-right-activist/672436/)"

**The Year Of Mastodon (and the 'Fediverse') On The Desktop**

The events of the last two months(!) have pushed people - you know, the thing one wants to use
social media to connect with - to alternatives in [a way that we've never experienced
before.](https://mashable.com/article/mastodon-millions-users) I'd been hoping for a long time that
an alternative would become popular and viable<footnote>, and it seems that Mastodon is finally
becoming just that. I've only been using it for a couple days on this last go around, but the
experience is far, far different with so many people embracing it and eyeing Twitter burning in a
dumpster in their rear view mirror.

I'm very keen on the web returning to the idea of [protocols over
platforms](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech).
To that end, I'm permanently ending my Twitter usage and going all in on the 'Fediverse' and - dare
I say - one of the few instances in the modern hype cycle of Decentralized Everything that may
indeed make great sense: decentralized social media. I've removed all links to Twitter from my
website, and have removed all usage of Twitter as a 3rd party OAuth provider.

Mastodon may not end up being the long game implementation of choice in the decentralized game;
hell, maybe even Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's Bluesky Social will be. But it's clear that social
media is on a path towards decentralization and shared governance in a way that doesn't fit any
single company trying to get rich on advertising and engagement, and I'm thrilled about it.
