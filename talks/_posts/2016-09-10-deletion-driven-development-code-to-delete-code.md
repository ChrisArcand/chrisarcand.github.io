### Abstract

Good news! Ruby is a successful and mature programming language with a wealth
of libraries and legacy applications that have been contributed to for many
years. The bad news: Those projects might contain a large amount of useless,
unused code which adds needless complexity and confuses new developers. In this
talk I'll explain how to build a static analysis tool to help you clear out the
cruft - because there's no code that's easier to maintain than no code at all!
