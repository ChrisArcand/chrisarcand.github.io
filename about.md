I'm a platform engineer at [Red Hat][1]{:target="_blank"} on the
[ManageIQ][2]{:target="_blank"} core team. ManageIQ is the open source cloud
management platform behind [Red Hat CloudForms][3]{:target="_blank"}.  I call
the [Twin Cities][7]{:target="_blank"} of [Minneapolis][8]{:target="_blank"}
and [St. Paul][9]{:target="_blank"}, [Minnesota][10]{:target="_blank"} my home.

I've enjoyed working remotely since 2014 and have worked full-time on open
source software since 2015. I also enjoy public speaking, having spoken at
major conferences as close as the American Midwest and as far as Kyoto, Japan.

Outside of programming I love backpacking, [ice
hockey](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeecYWCAo6i/), and performing/listening to
music. Above all I simply aspire to be a good human being.
