I'm a senior engineer at [Software for Good][1]{:target="_blank"}, an
experienced team of do-gooders pairing cause with craft: we develop web and
mobile applications for organizations working toward positive environmental and
social change. I call the [Twin Cities][7]{:target="_blank"} of
[Minneapolis][8]{:target="_blank"} and [St. Paul][9]{:target="_blank"},
[Minnesota][10]{:target="_blank"} my home.

I'm a big advocate of distributed teams and open source, having worked fully or
partially remote since 2014 and full-time on open source software at [Red Hat][3]{:target="_blank"}
from 2015 to 2018. I also enjoy public speaking, having spoken at major
conferences as close as the American Midwest and as far as Kyoto, Japan.

Outside of programming I love backpacking, [ice
hockey](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeecYWCAo6i/), and performing/listening to
music. Above all I simply aspire to be a good human being.
