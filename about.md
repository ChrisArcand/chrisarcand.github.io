### Software Engineer...

I work as a software engineer at Sport Ngin in Minneapolis developing web applications in JavaScript and Ruby using Node.js and Rails.
I graduated from the University of Minnesota's College of Science and Engineering, where I earned a B.S. in computer science with an emphasis in software and data systems development.

I like working with the full web stack and playing around with *nix systems in my spare time, and have taken an interest in contributing
to the open source community. Hockey is fun to play and watch, and my favorite color happens to be trees. Oh, I haven't bored
you to death yet? Well, to learn more you should just <a href="/resume" target="_blank">see my resumé.</a>

### ...and Clarinetist
From 2012:

As a performer, orchestral clarinetist Chris Arcand has drawn acclaim for his
exuberant chamber performances and solo appearances featuring works of Bernstein,
Muczynski, Copland, Brahms, and others. He has performed in many ensembles and
events around the Twin Cities, including the Kenwood Symphony and numerous
organizations at Orchestra Hall in downtown Minneapolis. In 2006 and 2007,
Instrumentalist Magazine awarded Arcand their award for Outstanding Musicianship
in Minnesota. Performing at various festivals and clinics since 2005, he
has had the opportunity to collaborate with such composers as Frank Ticheli, Libby
Larsen, Alex Shapiro and Carter Pann. In 2007 he was named a Ferguson Scholar by
the University of Minnesota, School of Music.

As an instructor, Arcand enjoys teaching a private studio of students not only about playing the clarinet up to a professional level but about Western music as a whole and its many facets beyond a single woodwind's point of view. An affiliated faculty member at White Bear Lake High School, Arcand regularly holds master classes for clarinetists of White Bear Lake’s wind ensembles and is listed as a recommended instructor by the White Bear Band Boosters. He has also served as a faculty member of the David Thomas School of Music.

Originally from White Bear Lake, Minnesota, Arcand enrolled at the Rymer Hadley Academy Of Fine Arts playing the clarinet at age 9. He continued his studies with Richard Wyland, eventually deciding to audition to conservatories after high school. The distinguished Evergreen Club of Minneapolis awarded him a scholarship for the pursuit. Arcand earned his Bachelor of Music in Clarinet Performance from the University of Minnesota, where his principal teachers were Burt Hara and Craig Kirchoff. Using Buffett-Crampon clarinets, Mr. Arcand plays exclusively on Vandoren reeds.
