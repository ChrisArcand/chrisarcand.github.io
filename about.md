I'm a Ruby developer at [Red Hat][1]{:target="_blank"} on the [ManageIQ][2]{:target="_blank"} core team. ManageIQ
is the open source cloud management platform behind [Red Hat CloudForms][3]{:target="_blank"}.
I've enjoyed working remotely since 2014 and call the [Twin Cities][7]{:target="_blank"} of [Minneapolis][8]{:target="_blank"} and [St. Paul][9]{:target="_blank"}, [Minnesota][10]{:target="_blank"} my home.

I like working with the full web stack and [contributing to the open source
community][5]{:target="_blank"}. I've spoken at major conferences as close as
the American Midwest and as far as Kyoto, Japan.

Outside of programming I love backpacking, hockey, and
performing/listening to music. Above all I simply aspire to be a good human
being.
