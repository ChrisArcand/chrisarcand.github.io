### Software Engineer...

I'm a Ruby developer at [Red Hat][1], working with some [great people][4] on the [ManageIQ][2]/[CloudForms][3] team.
I've enjoyed working remotely since 2014 and currently reside in the Washington, DC area.

I like working with the full web stack and contributing to the open source community. Outside of programming I'm
obsessed with hockey, love performing and listening to music (surprise?), relish hiking, believe in the Oxford Comma,
and aspire to be a good human being.

### ...and Clarinetist
From 2012:

As a performer, orchestral clarinetist Chris Arcand has drawn acclaim for his exuberant chamber performances and solo
appearances featuring works of Bernstein, Muczynski, Copland, Brahms, and others. He has performed in many ensembles and
events around the Twin Cities, including the Kenwood Symphony and numerous organizations at Orchestra Hall in downtown
Minneapolis. In 2006 and 2007, Instrumentalist Magazine awarded Arcand their award for Outstanding Musicianship in
Minnesota. Performing at various festivals and clinics since 2005, he has had the opportunity to collaborate with such
composers as Frank Ticheli, Libby Larsen, Alex Shapiro and Carter Pann. In 2007 he was named a Ferguson Scholar by the
University of Minnesota, School of Music.

As an instructor, Arcand enjoys teaching a private studio of students not only about playing the clarinet up to a
professional level but about Western music as a whole and its many facets beyond a single woodwind's point of view. An
affiliated faculty member at White Bear Lake High School, Arcand regularly holds master classes for clarinetists of
White Bear Lake’s wind ensembles and is listed as a recommended instructor by the White Bear Band Boosters. He has also
served as a faculty member of the David Thomas School of Music.

Originally from White Bear Lake, Minnesota, Arcand enrolled at the Rymer Hadley Academy Of Fine Arts playing the
clarinet at age 9. He continued his studies with Richard Wyland, eventually deciding to audition to conservatories after
high school. The distinguished Evergreen Club of Minneapolis awarded him a scholarship for the pursuit. Arcand earned
his Bachelor of Music in Clarinet Performance from the University of Minnesota, where his principal teachers were Burt
Hara and Craig Kirchoff. Using Buffett-Crampon clarinets, Mr. Arcand plays exclusively on Vandoren reeds.
