I'm a software engineering lead at [HashiCorp][1]{:target="_blank"} where I work on
[Terraform][2]{:target="_blank"}, an open-source tool that provides a consistent
infrastructure-as-code workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services by codifying APIs into
declarative configuration files. I call the [Twin Cities][7]{:target="_blank"} of
[Minneapolis][8]{:target="_blank"} and [St. Paul][9]{:target="_blank"},
[Minnesota][10]{:target="_blank"} my home.

I'm a big advocate of distributed teams and open source, having spent the
majority of my career as a 100% remote employee and at other top tier open
source companies such as [Red Hat][3]{:target="_blank"}. As a public speaker I've
had the privilege of speaking at major conferences as close as the American
Midwest and as far as Kyoto, Japan.

Outside of programming I love backpacking, [ice
hockey](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeecYWCAo6i/), and fulfilling my
responsibility as a native Minnesotan to making pointless connections to
Minnesota at every opportunity.
