I'm an adept full stack developer with [years of experience][3] writing and
supporting Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications - and while I'm not working in
[the open source community that might be supporting your project][2], I could
be working directly on it for you!

**I'm available as a part-time contractor to help your project flourish.**

Along with Ruby and Rails, I have experience with or are interested in Elixir or Python based projects!
See my <a href="/CPA_resume.pdf" target="_blank">full resum√©</a> for details.

**Shoot me an email at [hireme@chrisarcand.com][1] to learn more.**
